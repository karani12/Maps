# Maps 

C# is a language I seem to love due to the ability to do 
desktop apps and even more.
I was surprised to see an ssl certificate  on Asp.net apps for development functions.
Maybe it's a norm

## Aim of the project
- Learb more about windows form, using forms, depending strings amongst other things.

## How it works
Has a form that the user inputs either one of the three
- city
- street 
- zip

The entries by the user are then appended to a url for google maps
The window is two sides
- A form
- A browser

The url is then processed on the browser that displays the results on the same window

The browser is inbuilt  on visual studio that is compiled in the application.

###  C# 
I seem to like it more and more as I learn about it.
